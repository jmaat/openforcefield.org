![Quip Pipeline](quip.png "Quip Pipeline")

Improper torsions have been given little attention in force fields and need correction to capture intermediate geometries of trivalent atom centers in molecular simulations, as well as to better capture energetics of out-of-plan perturbations generally. Jessica Maat and the Mobley group are developing Quip (Quantum improper parameterization) tool that will provide a method for parameterization of improper torsions. The pipeline takes in SMILES strings, performs an initial geometry optimization, perturbs the geometric coordinates in the improper torsion and executes a set of restrained geometry optimizations to map out the QM energy landscape near the minimum for fitting. The future plans for this work are to integrate Quip with QCFractal, improve automation and user accessibility, and increase the amount of the diverse molecule set applied through the pipeline.
